# MathsStuff

A load of maths stuff - or 'math' if you prefer. These are just my notes for various books and courses.

The svgz files can be viewed in a browser but were generated using software called 'Write' which emulates pen & paper using a graphics tablet. It's free and very good (http://www.styluslabs.com/download/). Alongside that I also use Mathematica on the Raspberry Pi as it is full featured and free and useful for checking solutions when books do not give them.
